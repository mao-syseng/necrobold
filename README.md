## Notes
480 x 270 resolution scales nicely, 4x would be 1920 x 1080



*Procedural generated map maybe?*
Derek Yu made a bunch of 8x8 tiled templates, put them randomly in a 4x4 grid, start at top, end at bottom. 


## Barbuta
- 16x16 sprite
- 16x16 tiles
- jump looks to be 1.5 tiles
    - landing has animation and sound effect
